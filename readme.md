I first wrote some code myself. And it was pretty lengthy as you can see. I then asked AI to suggest me an alternative way to write it. I then took AI's version and compared it to mine, then created a final version merging both of them.

Now of course when I was doing the version control during this project I wasnt well versed in using Git, and tbh Im still learning it.

And oh, this is project 1 that I made in HTML.
